## Cache Folder

The `cache` folder is used for temporary storage. It holds data that can be quickly accessed and reused without needing to be recalculated or fetched again. This helps improve the performance of the application by reducing the need for repetitive operations.

**Note:** The contents of the `cache` folder can usually be safely deleted if needed, as they will be regenerated as required by the application.
